*Explore the graph, one query at a time.* 

Neo4j Browser is http://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/[Neo4j's] built-in client application, a mashup of a REPL, data visualization and lightweight IDE.

== Goals ==

* developer focused
* every interaction is a demonstration
* uses only public APIs
* for modern browsers, with reasonable fallbacks

== Development ==

Management::

  * https://trello.com/b/3QpahIAK/team-pop[Trello Wall]

How-to::

This sets up localhost:9000 to run server and browser. Any local changes will be applied here immediatley by reloading the page.
