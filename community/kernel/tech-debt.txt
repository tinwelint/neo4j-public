[2010-02-10] Better testing for broken entries in logical log
    Currently the test code for broken entries does not test all possible 
    combinations of broken entries (meaning crash during write of entry so it 
    was incomplete). This is fine since a broken command entry will never be 
    executed because it would then have to have a following prepare entry (can 
    not happen since we do flush on them). Would however be nice to have code 
    that tests this so user don't get an exception on recovery.

[2010-02-25] Bug fix [3933] needs to be merged into 1.0.1

[2010-02-25] Embedd checksum to logical log
    We need to be able to do a checksum on the logical log before applying it 
    during replication/backup.

[2010-09-09] Uniform configuration of components
    There should be a uniform mechanism for non-programmatic component and 
    extension configuration (settings for which there is no direct API).
    
[2010-09-10] Expose build revision in JMX kernel bean
    Now that the revision is available in a public api, it should also
    be included in the jmx kernel bean. This will be particularly helpful
    for reporting problems (since build revision will be a little more
    particular than kernel version).
